            <h3>Finding simplicity in life</h3>
            <p><span class="bold">Life can get complicated really quickly</span>, but it doesn't have to be! There are
                many ways to simplify your life, <a href="#" class="a0">few of which we've explored in the past.</a>This
                week we're taking a bit of a approach though, in how you can find simplicity in the life you already
                living.</p>

            <h3>Keeping cooking simple</h3>
            <p>Food is a very important part of everyone's life. If you want to be healthy, you have to eat healthy. One

            <h3>Simplicity and work</h3>
            <p>Work is often a major source of stress. People get frustrated, it ruins their relationship with
                others and it leads to burnout. By keeping your work life as simple as possible, it will help
                balance everything out.</p>

            <h3>Simple decorations</h3>
            <p>A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People either don't decorate, or they go
                overboard and it doesn't have the impact they were hoping for. Staying simple will help draw the
                eye where you want it to and make things pop like never before.</p>
